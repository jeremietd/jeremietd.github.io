I'm an MSc student in Precision Health & Medicine at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/). I am interested in the intersection of computational biology and machine learning, especially in the development and validation of protein language models for designing novel, functional proteins. This includes the development of networks, optimization strategies, and _in silico_ evaluation methods. I worked with [Pascal Notin](pascalnotin.com) on the effects sampling methods on protein language models for generative protein design.

I completed my BSc in Bioinformatics at the [Indonesia International Institute for Life Sciences (i3L)](https://i3l.ac.id/) and conducted my BSc thesis and other research in the [National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST)](https://www.ntust.edu.tw/?Lang=en).
